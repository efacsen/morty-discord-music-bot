# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Docker phase (5) placed after Command Audit (4) — user: "docker should we implement after we test everything is working"
- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 6 requirement categories; standard granularity
- Stack: discord-player pinned at exactly 7.2.0 (no caret) — willPlayTrack resolver signature is version-specific
- Stack: @snazzah/davey must survive migration — no source file imports it, tools will try to prune it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Setup Wizard): Cross-platform subprocess execution and Windows portable runtime download patterns need validation. Research flags a targeted spike on Windows setup UX before implementation.
- Phase 5 (Docker): yt-dlp `--js-runtimes node` exact syntax needs validation against current yt-dlp release. Standalone binary is the safer fallback.
- Phase 2: Dynamic loader path difference between `tsx` (resolves `.ts`) and `node dist/` (resolves `.js`) must be addressed during planning.
